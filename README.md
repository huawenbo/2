# QR factorization 

## QR factorization is a decomposition of a matrix $A$ into a product $A = QR$ of an orthonormal matrix $Q$ and an upper triangular matrix $R$. Here, we conduct QR factorization using three different algorithms.

- The algorithm based on **Gran-Schmidt** orthogonalization for square matrices with full rank (non-singular matrices)

- The algorithm based on the column principal elements of the **Householder** matrix.

- The algorithm based on **Givens** variation (only used for square arrays and has no column primitives).

## These methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Generally, we first choose householder method.
